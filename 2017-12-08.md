##	Size-by-year paper

1. Compute correlation of anomalies, not just SDs, to see if the directions match, as well as magnitudes and variation
2. ID outliers on the SD anomaly plot (new one) to see how those map to the buffering experiment
3. Stats say use SxY because it helps explain variability at the individual level, but doesn't matter at population level because variation of small plants doesn't matter
4. Make SD anomaly plot for small plants too
5. Start re-writing!
